        // TODO 1 (20 points) - The file "courses.txt" has 5 columns.  Create and call a function
        // that given a file name and a column number, returns an ArrayList of Strings with the
        // values from that column of data.  For example, if the column number is 2 then an
        // ArrayList of titles will be returned.  If the column number is 5 then an ArrayList of
        // credit hours (stored as Strings) will be returned.  Call this function 5 times to create
        // the 5 ArrayLists for each of the columns of data.

        

        // TODO 2 (20 points) - Create and call a user-defined function that given two indexes,
        // swaps the data for those two courses.  For example, if the two indices are 0 and 1, then
        // the first two courses in the ArrayLists must be exchanged.



        // TODO 3 (20 points) - The real fun of this project is to make it easy for users to rate
        // XCore courses.  These ratings are for reading, writing, thinking,and fun.  For each of
        // the courses, randomly generate 4 ratings in the range 0..6. The 4 ratings must be stored
        // in an array.  Don't write a function for this, do this in main().



        // TODO 4 (20 points) - Write a function that returns an ArrayList of titles for all
        // courses that have an {X} fun rating where X is a parameter to this function.



        // TODO 5 (20 points) - What are the titles of courses with the sum of ratings at least {X}
        // where X is a parameter to this function.
